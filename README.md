# retro Ace PacMan

## My version of pac-man for the Jupiter Ace


this game is developed in C using Z88DK 

## pre-requisites

*please install the following applications:*
+ Compiler Z88DK : get a nightly build at http://nightly.z88dk.org/   
+ EightyOne emulator: get it at https://www.jupiter-ace.co.uk/emulators_win.html  

## build notes

Use the **build.cmd** script. It supposes that **zcc.exe** is reachable (i.e. its path is in the environment variable PATH).  
The **build_wav.cmd** script generates a **.wav** file, useful if you want to load the game in a real Jupiter Ace or a Minstrel 4.
